NOTES:
The Recipe class contains CASCADE.ALL for Notes & Ingredient POJO mapping as Recipe here is the prime class and there will be no existence of Notes & Ingredient without Recipe. Hence, we will not be creating separate repositories for Notes & Ingredient. We are only creating repositories for Recipe, Category & UnitOfMeasure classes.
