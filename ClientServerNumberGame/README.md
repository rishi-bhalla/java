This is a simple number game being played between the client and the server.

The server acts as the host for this game and the client connects to the server to play.

The client connects to the server, authenticates itself using id and password and plays a specific amount (both user id and password for this application are "test"). The server offers three numbers to the client to choose.

If the number chosen by the client matches the lucky number, client wins else the client looses.

Depending upon whether the client wins or looses, the amount of money available increases or decreases.

The details of the game along with pictorial representation is present in the resources directory of the project.

To play the game, start the "GameServer" and "Client" individually and start playing.
