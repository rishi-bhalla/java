This project contains multiple basic SpringBoot applications namely
1. Greeting
2. Student
3. User

1. Greeting - a simpmle rest api returning a greeting message to the name being passed in the query param.
2. Student - a simple application containing all the CRUD operations for a student. This app contains all static data with no association with the backend.
3. User - a simple application containing all the CRUD operations for a user. This app interacts with the backend database (mysql in this case).

PS: To test all the three applications, the necessary postman collection containing the sample API's has also been included at the root level of the application.
    One can simple import this postman collection to test all the API's.
